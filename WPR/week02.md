### Updates:

- I have been primarily working on creating an agent for CycloneDX.
- I have successfully created an agent that retrieves the necessary data for
  generating a CycloneDX report from the FOSSology database.
- Currently, the agent is running in CLI (Command Line Interface) mode.
- I used the SPDX agent as a reference to create this agent.

### Conclusion and further plans:

- In the upcoming weeks, I will be working on generating CycloneDX reports by
  utilizing the data from the FOSSology database.
- Additionally, I will be working on determining the similarities between SPDX
  and CycloneDX reports.
